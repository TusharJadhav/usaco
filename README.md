# USACO solutions

[USACO](http://www.usaco.org/) provides free training material and practice problems to improve your algorithmic problem solving skills. This repository contains solutions to the problems, that I have attempted to solve in the USACO training. 
The solutions are solved using modern C++ language. At-least, C++11 compliant compiler is need to compile the solutions. The problems can be found [here](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=training).
I would highly recommend you to attempt solving the problems by yourself first before looking at the solution directly, since it defeats the whole purpose of training. All the problems belong to USACO and they have full rights over them. The solutions presented by me, may not be the best solution to the problem under consideration and there might be other efficient solutions out there.
